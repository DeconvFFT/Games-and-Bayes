# This is the part you'll want to modify!

class ComputerPlayer:
    # This function should generate a series of commands to move the piece into the "optimal"
    # position. The commands are a string of letters, where b and m represent left and right, respectively,
    # and n rotates. quintris is an object that lets you inspect the board, e.g.:
    #   - quintris.col, quintris.row have the current column and row of the upper-left corner of the 
    #     falling piece
    #   - quintris.get_piece() is the current piece, quintris.get_next_piece() is the next piece after that
    #   - quintris.left(), quintris.right(), quintris.down(), and quintris.rotate() can be called to actually
    #     issue game commands
    #   - quintris.get_board() returns the current state of the board, as a list of strings.
    #
    def get_moves(self, quintris):
        # super simple current algorithm: just randomly move left, right, and rotate a few times
        return random.choice("mnbh") * random.randint(1, 10)
       
    # This is the version that's used by the animted version. This is really similar to get_moves,
    # except that it runs as a separate thread and you should access various methods and data in
    # the "quintris" object to control the movement. In particular:
    #   - quintris.col, quintris.row have the current column and row of the upper-left corner of the 
    #     falling piece
    #   - quintris.get_piece() is the current piece, quintris.get_next_piece() is the next piece after that
    #   - quintris.left(), quintris.right(), quintris.down(), and quintris.rotate() can be called to actually
    #     issue game commands
    #   - quintris.get_board() returns the current state of the board, as a list of strings.
    #
    def control_game(self, quintris):
        # another super simple algorithm: just move piece to the least-full column
        while 1:
            time.sleep(0.1)

            board = quintris.get_board()
            column_heights = [ min([ r for r in range(len(board)-1, 0, -1) if board[r][c] == "x"  ] + [100,] ) for c in range(0, len(board[0]) ) ]
